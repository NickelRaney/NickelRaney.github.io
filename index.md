## About Me

* I am a senior year student of mathematics at Peking University, majoring in computational mathematics. Currently I'm advised by Professor [Louis Tao](https://www.cbi.pku.edu.cn/people/cbifaculty/265951.html).

* This is my resume.

## Research Interest

I'm interested in computational neuroscience - applying mathematical tools to elucidate principles in neuroscience. My previous work mainly focused on using techniques in stochastic process and dynamical system to model [Gamma oscillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_wave). I also worked on mathematical models capturing the function of [ipRGC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsically_photosensitive_retinal_ganglion_cell) neurons in [lateral geniculate nucleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateral_geniculate_nucleus).
